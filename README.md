#### Implementation of Transfer Learning of VGG-19 model
This repo consists of the implementaion of the famous VGG-19 model using transfer learning. The VGG-19 is a convolutional neural network model that uses computer vision that is trained over a million images to classify over 1000 different objects. It consists of 19 layers.
